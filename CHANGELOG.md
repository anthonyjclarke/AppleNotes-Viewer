# Changelog

## [2.0.0] 11-05-2026

Complete rewrite. The app is now built around the
[`apple-notes-exporter`](https://github.com/nicholasstephan/apple-notes-exporter) CLI
instead of Falcon Notes Exporter. The Notes folder is user-selectable via the in-app
Settings page — no manual file placement required.

### Added

- Settings page with file-browser overlay for selecting the Notes export folder
- Startup loading overlay with progress bar — server is immediately available while
  indexing runs in a background thread
- Sync button in sidebar — runs `apple-notes-exporter --incremental` then re-indexes
  without restarting the server; progress tracked live
- PDF preview modal — inline viewer with "Open in new tab" fallback; triggered by
  clicking anywhere on an attachment card (filename, icon, or type label)
- Resizable sidebar panel (folders + tags); width persists in `localStorage`
- Tag pills grid replacing the previous list-style tag display, matching Apple Notes style
- `sync.sh` — configurable sync wrapper around `apple-notes-exporter`
- `<meta name="modified">` parsing as primary date source; mtime as fallback

### Changed

- Notes folder is now configured via the Settings UI rather than manually placed in
  `Notes/` — path stored in `config.json` (gitignored)
- Startup is now asynchronous — HTTP server binds immediately, browser opens to a
  loading screen while indexing completes in the background
- Tag display redesigned from a list (with `#` icon prefix) to a wrapping pill grid
- Both the sidebar↔list and list↔content dividers are now draggable resize handles

### Fixed

- `#` in folder or file names caused 404 errors — fixed by per-segment URL encoding
  so `#` becomes `%23`, not a URL fragment
- Settings save race condition: index progress `active` flag is now set in the POST
  handler before the background thread starts, preventing premature redirect with old data
- PDF attachment card: clicking the emoji icon or "Scan File" label (siblings of the
  `<a>` element) now correctly opens the modal; the outer card div is also marked
  with `data-pdf-href` during rewriting

- Light/dark mode toggle; preference persists in `localStorage`
